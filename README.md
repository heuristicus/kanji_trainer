A small program intended to work somewhat like flashcards, only more flexible and easy to modify. Files of a specific layout can be read by the program and then displayed in steps.

Currently only tested with the Meiryo font, which should be available as a free download for Windows users at http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=10550. Can't really think of any reason why it shouldn't work if you don't have the font, though.

## Future features:

- Improvements to the item selection method.
- Specify a number of items to go through in a session
- Method of parsing in a structured file that the user has created
- Selection of items in the file that you want to work on
- Some way of testing the user's answers
- Keep settings between sessions (in a file?)
- GUI improvements (layout of viewing area)
- Creation of items from inside the program
- Keep session statistics (items viewed, if answering implemented, correct percentage, time taken etc.)
- Font selection
- Key navigation improvements

## Completed features

- Automatically reveal hiragana after some time (04/08/11)
- Choose whether hiragana or kanji is initially revealed (30/10/11)
- Something better than choosing entirely randomly which item to display next (31/10/11)
- Pause when items are set to automatically display (12/11/11)
