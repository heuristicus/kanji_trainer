Currently only works with the Meiryo font, which should be available as a free download for Windows users at http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=10550

Likely future features:

Automatically reveal hiragana after some time
Choose whether hiragana or kanji is initially revealed
Something better than choosing entirely randomly which item to display next
